# Multi-Node Scheduler Improvements

## Changes Made

### Issue 1: Removed Single-Node vs Multi-Node Separation

**Problem**: The `mgpu_srun_multinode.py` script was deciding between UNIX socket (single-node) and TCP socket (multi-node), requiring users to choose the correct mode.

**Solution**: Modified the script to always use the multi-node master server via TCP connection. The server automatically detects available GPU resources and handles both single-node and multi-node requests seamlessly.

**Changes in `mgpu_srun_multinode.py`**:
- Removed `is_multinode` detection logic
- Always use TCP connection to master server
- Simplified request format to use unified structure
- Updated error handling and cancellation to use TCP connections

### Issue 2: Fixed mgpu_queue Command for Multi-Node

**Problem**: The `mgpu_queue.py` command only worked with the single-node scheduler via UNIX socket, failing with multi-node deployments.

**Solution**: Updated to connect to the multi-node master server via TCP and enhanced the output format for distributed jobs.

**Changes in `mgpu_queue.py`**:
- Use TCP connection instead of UNIX socket
- Added support for environment variables `MGPU_MASTER_HOST` and `MGPU_MASTER_PORT`
- Enhanced job display to show distributed job information (node assignments, distributed type)
- Added cluster status display showing node availability

### Issue 3: Fixed mgpu_cancel Command for Multi-Node

**Problem**: The `mgpu_cancel.py` command only worked with the single-node scheduler.

**Solution**: Updated to work with the multi-node master server.

**Changes in `mgpu_cancel.py`**:
- Use TCP connection to master server
- Added environment variable support
- Improved error messages and user guidance

### Issue 4: Added Cancel Support to Master Server

**Problem**: The master server didn't have job cancellation functionality.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive cancel support to the `MultiNodeScheduler` class.

**Changes in `mgpu_master_server.py`**:
- Added `cancel_job()` method to `MultiNodeScheduler` class
- Handles cancellation of both queued and running jobs
- Sends cancel requests to remote nodes for distributed jobs
- Added `cancel` command handler in the main server loop
- Proper cleanup of job state and resource allocation

## Configuration

All commands now support environment variables for easy configuration:

```bash
export MGPU_MASTER_HOST=<master_server_ip>
export MGPU_MASTER_PORT=<master_server_port>
```

If not set, defaults to `localhost:8080`.

## Usage Examples

### Unified Job Submission
```bash
# Single node job (auto-detected)
mgpu_srun --gpu-ids 0,1 -- python train.py

# Multi-node job (auto-detected)
mgpu_srun --nodes 2 --gpus-per-node 4 --distributed -- torchrun --nnodes=2 --nproc_per_node=4 train.py

# Specific nodes
mgpu_srun --nodelist node001,node002 --gpus-per-node 2 -- python train.py
```

### Queue Management
```bash
# Check queue status (works with multi-node)
mgpu_queue

# Cancel a job (works with multi-node)
mgpu_cancel JOB12345
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplified User Experience**: No need to choose between single-node and multi-node modes
2. **Automatic Resource Detection**: Server automatically determines the best resource allocation
3. **Unified Command Interface**: All commands work consistently across different deployment scenarios
4. **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages and fallback mechanisms
5. **Enhanced Queue Visibility**: Better display of distributed job information and cluster status

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing command-line options continue to work
- Environment variable configuration is optional (falls back to defaults)
- The master server can handle both simple and complex job requests seamlessly
