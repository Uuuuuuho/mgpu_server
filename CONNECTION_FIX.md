# Connection Issue Fix

## Problem Description
The master server was receiving heartbeats from node agents but failing to get resource information with the error:
```
[WARNING] Failed to get resources from node001: No connection to node node001
[DEBUG] No connection established to node001
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a mismatch in connection handling between the master server and node agents:

1. **Master Server**: Was trying to maintain persistent connections to node agents and reuse them for resource queries
2. **Node Agent**: Was designed to handle individual request-response connections that get closed after each request

The master server's `connect_to_nodes()` method established connections during initialization, but the node agents closed these connections after handling the first request, leaving the master with stale socket connections.

## Solution
Modified the master server to use individual connections for each resource query, similar to how heartbeats work:

### Changes Made

1. **Removed Persistent Connection Management**:
   - Removed `self.node_connections` dictionary from `ClusterResourceManager`
   - Updated `connect_to_nodes()` to only test connectivity, not maintain connections

2. **Updated Resource Query Method**:
   - Modified `query_node_resources()` to create a new connection for each request
   - Added proper error handling and response parsing
   - Ensures connections are properly closed after each request

3. **Updated Job Execution Methods**:
   - Modified `start_single_node_job()` and `start_multi_node_job()` to use individual connections
   - Added proper response handling and error checking

4. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Better error messages and debugging information
   - Proper socket cleanup in all connection methods

## How It Works Now

1. **Heartbeats**: Node agents send heartbeats to master server (unchanged)
2. **Resource Queries**: Master server creates new connection for each resource query
3. **Job Execution**: Master server creates new connection for each job command

All connections follow the same pattern:
1. Create socket
2. Connect to node
3. Send request
4. Receive response
5. Close socket

## Testing
A test script `test_connection.py` has been created to verify the fix:

```bash
python3 test_connection.py
```

This script tests both:
- Node agent resource queries
- Master server heartbeat handling

## Files Modified
- `/src/mgpu_master_server.py`: Main fix implementation
- `/src/mgpu_node_agent.py`: Minor logging improvements
- `/test_connection.py`: New test script

## Verification
After applying this fix, you should see:
1. Successful resource queries from the master server
2. No more "No connection to node" errors
3. Proper resource information being displayed

The connection between master and agents should now work reliably with individual request-response cycles rather than persistent connections.
